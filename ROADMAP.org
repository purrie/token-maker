#+title: Roadmap

This document contains ideas and goals for the project as well as description of progress for each. Entries closer to the top can be considered of higher priority for current development.

* TODO Production
This is a list of functionality what I want for the program to consider it ready to be used by regular people

** UI/UX [8/8]
- [X] Frames need to have improved frame choice UI and implement categories
- [X] Make offset be displayed at 0 instead of center of the image
- [X] Export button should become red if any workspace points to a file that already exist
- [X] There should be a button that allows switching base/source image for all workspaces at once
- [X] Move close button to top bar and have it choose which workspace to close
- [X] Color Picker should allow direct value input
- [X] Make tooltips have better visibility
- [X] The Workspace tabs should be moved to the header line, or at least made it so they don't steal space from workspace buttons

** Bug fixes [3/4]
- [X] Trackpad doesn't release when the button is released off its area.
- [X] There's no way to reset trackpad zoom level
- [X] Color Picker gets clipped away on the window edge
- [ ] Frame modifier frames need to be centered within buttons

** Modifiers [1/5]
- [ ] Ability to reorder modifiers
- [ ] Custom widget or style for modifier list items
- [ ] There needs to be clear distinction as to which modifier is currently selected
- [ ] Auto-alpha / greenscreen modifier
- [X] Backgrounds modifier

** Manual
There needs to be a document that properly outlines the functionality of the program and its components. Maybe a website? Something accessible locally would be nice, so I could distribute it with the program, especially if it would be accessible through the program itself.


* Modifiers
Bonus points if modifiers could be applied only to specified part of the image

** Reordering
The UI needs to offer an easy way to reorder modifiers

** Backgrounds
An image could be moved out of the frame of the final result, user should have ability to specify a color or image to use for background.

** Alpha paint
Modifier for adjusting alpha on the image

** Color paint
Basic color adjust modifier to paint simple things so you don't have to go through a painting program if you just want to recolor someone's eyes and similar minor adjustments

** IDEA Image compositing
Would it be useful to have an ability to combine multiple images into one token/card/portrait? This could be reaching outside the scope of the program tho.

** Auto alpha
Inspired by my SL shop thumbnail maker material I've made. User should have ability to specify which color to auto alpha out for images that have solid or mostly solid color background.

** Filters
Stuff for blurs, glows, color shifts and so on.

** Transforms
Ability to scale, rotate or move image through a modifier

** DONE Frames
frame modifier with ability to mask out area outside the frame

** Decorations
Additional icons and other stuff that user can throw into the image, adding simple decorations.

** Text
There should be ability to add text to the token or card. This crate seems like could be helpful here: https://crates.io/crates/text-to-png/0.2.0

** Outline
This one would be useful for standees

** Unalpha
Some nice looking tokens support parts of the image going outside of the token frame, overriding its alpha. Would be nice to have that functionality. I imagine it as giving the user a paint brush which he would paint the picture with. Any part painted over of the picture would go over the frame and would not be masked out by the frame.

The issue with this one is cyclic dependency. Or ability to lock pixels so next modifiers don't override them.

This could be implemented as a mask for modifiers since more than just a frame could benefit from being able to limit its effects to specific parts of the image. Counterargument here is that this is a specialized case where painting would conform to visible parts of the image rather than to the brush. ( I think this one is my favorite since a lot of modifiers would benefit from ability to specify which parts of the image they affect and how much. )

This could be implemented if the ImageOperations would take both working image and source image for the operation so the modifier could copy parts of the image from the source even when being placed as the last modifier

This could be implemented if there was a way for modifiers to store data that would be accessible to other modifiers down the line. There could be a hook modifier which would provide data for later modifiers. Something similar as what exists in Substance Painter

* TODO Art
** Themes
- Primitive
- Roman
- Medieval
- Fantasy
- Pre-modern
- Modern
- Cyberpunk
- Sci-Fi

** TODO Frame Art
- Square frames
- Pentagonal frames
- Hexagonal frames
- Turned hexagonal frames

*** Round Thin
Most thin frames won't be very visible so they don't need anything elaborate on the frame itself.

*** Round Thick
Thick frames have enough space to have some basic patterns drawn on them.

** Card Art
Going to wait for text modifier with this one probably

** Border frames
For portraits. In portrait and landscape aspects.

** Decorations
Various minor icons that can be added onto the image

* Manual
The program itself should have tooltips and other ways of instructing the user without needing to read through the actual manual for basic usage. The principle here is that an user should be able to install the program, turn it on and be able to produce a basic result with little to no external instruction.

* TODO Workspace Templates
Just a way to quickly add and set up the workspace with basic defaults for specific purpose
** DONE Token
  Image within round/square/hexagonal frame
** DONE Portrait
  Image with or without border frame
** Card
  Image with big frame and space for text
** Standee
  Image with alpha masked background and outline in customizable color

This should be both a menu or set of buttons that will quickly add a workspace with selected template using the image loaded in the last workspace, as well as a set of choices in the regular new workspace screen to quickly set it up after loading the image.

* File browser
- Bookmarks for easier navigation
- Image preview area to allow user to see the selected image file

* Icons
Button text should be replaced with icons when it makes sense. Which would primarily mean header buttons.

* TODO Image Source
** DONE URL source
User should be able to use url to obtain the image

** TODO Paste source
copy pasting image into the program

** Drag and drop support

* IDEA Screen capture
Would be cool to have built in screen capture tool.

* IDEA Animations
Support for creating animated tokens

Could be done by animating values of filters, or having a collection of filters for each key frame

* IDEA Project Saving
Once I implement animations, it will probably be a good idea to also implement a way of saving the project so the work is not lost if someone wants to tweak the animation.

* DONE Frame maker
Need a workspace mode which would be for making frames, probably with its own template. Tho, to signify that this mode is for making assets for the program itself, it could be a better idea to not shove it into workspaces since those are for making tokens and such. It could also be used for making decorations.

Then art can be created

- Implement folder/categories for token frames

* DONE Cache
Program needs to save cache with most recently used settings for workspaces, with support for templates. Cache needs to be saved for modifiers as well.

Values for program itself should be cached too.

This will likely be HashMap<ID, HashMap<String, String>> sort of structure where each part of the program would manage its own hashmap of things to be saved or loaded during update cycles. The final values for the hashmap could be an enum instead of a string. I think the keys can stay as some form of strings to not overcomplicate stuff.

* DONE Settings
- Choose color schemes
- Choose layout between divided space and tabs for workspaces
- Naming conventions
  This should give the user ability to set naming convention for different templates so user can add prefix, postfix or anything in between to the name for each template

* DONE Global project name
Aside from global path, user should be able to specify prefix, and possibly postfix for all exports so the individual workspace names are used mostly as distinguishers between the type

* DONE Adding Workspaces
Adding should be done through a button, which will add a faux workspace in which user will be able to choose either one of the loaded images from other workspaces or load a new one as a starting point

* DONE Layer support
Creating separate workflows for different outputs seems like unnecessary work. I think creating a layer workflow similar to painting programs would work best for supporting different output targets like tokens or cards.

Important to note is that this while there will be painting like features, painting isn't the goal of this program. Layers should work in a way that makes it easy to work with to create tokens, which I imagine is different than how it works in regular painting programs.

Layers should also make it easier to implement other features I want, serving a role of containers for modifiers, transformations and so on.

** DONE Properties
Each layer could have its own properties, those need to be displayed in most user friendly manner.
